# Handwritten-Calculator
Calculates hand written operations using a convolutional neural network trained on the MNIST dataset.

## Introduction
Many handwritten calculators based on the MNIST dataset have been created by amateur machine learning enthusiasts and are available online. However, none follow a rigorous approach to the problem as I have done in the following implementation. This repository will show you step by step how to create such an application: from the data augmentation for the calculator symbols to creating the user interface using PySimpleGUI.

I have split the problem into three parts: creating the dataset, training the model and then finally building the GUI. Feel free to only read the parts that you are interested in.
However, this was written in mind that you read it sequentially, therefore in order to fully understand why things are done the way they are it is best to read from start to finish.
